# Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This is my attempt at the Titanic project on Kaggle, found here:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview

I have been provided with two csv files - train.csv and test.csv - of data on passengers from the Titanic. The goal is use the training set to build a classification model that can predict whether a given passenger in the test set survived the disaster or not.

Below is the data description from Kaggle:

|Variable | Definition | Key |
|--- | --- | --- |
|survival | Survival |	0 = No, 1 = Yes |
|pclass | Ticket class | 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd |
|sex | Sex | 	
|Age |	Age in years | |
|sibsp | # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic | |
|parch |	# of parents / children aboard the Titanic | |
|ticket | Ticket number | |
|fare | Passenger fare | |
|cabin | Cabin number | |
|embarked | Port of Embarkation | C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton |
